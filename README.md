Task: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Question: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

We predict the number of clusters unsing unsupervised machine learning using the elbow method.

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. The algorithm aims to minimize the squared Euclidean distances between the observation and the centroid of cluster to which it belongs. 

From the visualization, we can see that the optimal number of clusters should be around 3. This is because we obsere no significant fall in the within clusters sum of squares.
